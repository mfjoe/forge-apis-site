      <p>Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation provides tax-free monthly payments to veterans who suffer from service-connected disabilities or conditions that originated during or were aggravated by military service. With over 5.2 million veterans receiving VA disability benefits totaling approximately $115 billion annually as of 2025, understanding the disability rating system, combined ratings calculations, dependent benefits, claim filing procedures, and appeals process is essential for maximizing your entitled compensation. This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic concepts to advanced strategies, helping veterans navigate the complex VA benefits landscape with confidence and secure the full compensation they've earned through their service and sacrifice.</p>

      <h2>What is VA Disability Compensation?</h2>
      
      <p>VA disability compensation is a tax-free monthly benefit paid to veterans with disabilities connected to their military service, providing financial support for reduced earning capacity and quality of life impacts caused by service-connected conditions. The compensation amount depends on your combined disability rating (ranging from 0% to 100% in 10% increments), number of eligible dependents, and specific circumstances like special monthly compensation (SMC) for severe disabilities. Unlike many other benefit programs, VA disability compensation has no income restrictions, doesn't require proof of financial need, and can be received while working full-time employment regardless of earnings.</p>

      <p>The VA's disability compensation program originated from the Bureau of War Risk Insurance established in 1914 and evolved significantly through the Veterans Administration's creation in 1930 and transformation into the Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989. The program recognizes that service members sacrifice their physical and mental health protecting the nation, and compensation helps offset lost earning potential, increased medical expenses, and reduced quality of life resulting from service-connected disabilities. Payment rates are adjusted annually based on Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLA) tied to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), ensuring benefits maintain purchasing power despite inflation.</p>

      <h3>Key Features of VA Disability Compensation:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tax-Free Income:</strong> All VA disability payments are completely exempt from federal, state, and local income taxes</li>
        <li><strong>No Income Cap:</strong> You can work and earn unlimited income while receiving benefits (except TDIU restrictions)</li>
        <li><strong>Retroactive Payments:</strong> Benefits are backdated to your claim filing date or separation date, whichever is more favorable</li>
        <li><strong>Annual COLA Increases:</strong> Automatic inflation adjustments ensure benefits keep pace with cost of living</li>
        <li><strong>Dependent Allowances:</strong> Additional compensation for spouse, children, and parents at ratings 30% and higher</li>
        <li><strong>Protected Benefits:</strong> Cannot be garnished for most debts (except child support, alimony, and IRS debts)</li>
        <li><strong>Concurrent Receipt:</strong> Can receive both military retirement pay and VA disability (CRDP/CRSC programs)</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Priority:</strong> Higher disability ratings grant priority enrollment and free VA healthcare services</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Understanding the VA Disability Rating System</h2>

      <p>The VA disability rating system quantifies the severity of service-connected conditions using percentages from 0% to 100% in 10% increments (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.), with each rating tier corresponding to specific monthly compensation amounts. Ratings are assigned based on the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38 CFR Part 4), which contains diagnostic codes for thousands of medical conditions organized by body system, with detailed criteria describing symptom severity and functional impairment required for each rating percentage. The rating reflects how much the condition impacts your ability to function in civilian employment and daily activities, not necessarily how much the condition bothers you personally.</p>

      <p>Each service-connected condition receives its own individual disability rating, and multiple conditions are mathematically combined using the VA's Combined Ratings Table rather than simple addition. This combined approach prevents total disability from exceeding 100% while ensuring veterans with multiple conditions receive progressively higher compensation reflecting cumulative impairment. For example, a veteran with individual ratings of 70%, 50%, and 30% doesn't receive 150% combined—instead, the mathematical combination yields approximately 92%, which rounds to 90% for compensation purposes.</p>

      <h3>How Individual Disability Ratings Are Assigned</h3>
      <p>VA rating specialists (Veterans Service Representatives and Rating Veterans Service Representatives) evaluate your claim by reviewing medical evidence, service treatment records, VA examination results (C&P exams), and applying diagnostic codes from 38 CFR Part 4. Key factors considered include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Symptom frequency and severity:</strong> How often symptoms occur and how intense they are when present</li>
        <li><strong>Functional impairment:</strong> Impact on ability to work, care for yourself, and engage in daily activities</li>
        <li><strong>Treatment requirements:</strong> Medications needed, hospitalizations, ongoing therapy or specialized care</li>
        <li><strong>Occupational limitations:</strong> Specific work activities that are difficult or impossible due to the condition</li>
        <li><strong>Social functioning:</strong> Impact on relationships, social interactions, and quality of life</li>
        <li><strong>Range of motion:</strong> For musculoskeletal conditions, measured movement limitations in degrees</li>
        <li><strong>Special considerations:</strong> Dominant hand involvement, bilateral factor (both sides affected), pyramiding restrictions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The VA Combined Ratings Table Explained</h2>

      <p>The VA Combined Ratings Table uses a mathematical formula based on efficiency loss rather than simple percentage addition, recognizing that each additional disability impacts remaining functional capacity, not total capacity. The system treats each veteran as starting with 100% efficiency, and each disability rating represents the percentage of efficiency lost to that specific condition. When combining multiple ratings, each subsequent disability percentage applies only to the veteran's remaining efficiency after accounting for previously rated conditions.</p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Combined Rating Calculation</h3>
      <p>Here's the precise methodology for calculating combined ratings with a detailed example:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Arrange ratings in descending order:</strong> List all individual disability ratings from highest to lowest percentage. Example: 70%, 50%, 30%, 20%</li>
        <li><strong>Start with the highest rating:</strong> Your first disability establishes the baseline. Example: 70% means 70% efficiency lost, 30% efficiency remaining</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate the second disability's impact:</strong> Apply the second rating percentage to your remaining efficiency. Example: 50% × 30% remaining = 15% additional loss. Combined: 70% + 15% = 85%</li>
        <li><strong>Continue for each additional disability:</strong> With 85% combined, you have 15% remaining efficiency. Apply third rating: 30% × 15% = 4.5% additional loss. Combined: 85% + 4.5% = 89.5%</li>
        <li><strong>Apply all remaining ratings:</strong> With 89.5% combined, you have 10.5% remaining. Apply fourth rating: 20% × 10.5% = 2.1% additional loss. Combined: 89.5% + 2.1% = 91.6%</li>
        <li><strong>Round to nearest 10%:</strong> Final combined rating of 91.6% rounds to 90% for compensation purposes (rounding up at 95 or higher, down below 95)</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <h4 style="margin: 0 0 0.75rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">💡 Important Rounding Rules</h4>
        <p>The VA uses specific rounding rules: ratings ending in 1, 2, 3, or 4 round down to the nearest 10% (e.g., 74% becomes 70%), while ratings ending in 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 round up to the nearest 10% (e.g., 75% becomes 80%). The only exception is that 95% or higher rounds to 100%. This rounding significantly impacts your monthly compensation, as each 10% tier represents substantial payment increases, particularly at higher rating levels.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>Strategic Insight:</strong> If your combined rating calculates to 94%, you're just 1% away from 100% combined rating. Consider filing supplemental claims for conditions that may have worsened or secondary conditions that developed, as even a small increase in any individual rating could push your combined rating to 95%+ and round to 100%.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>2025 VA Disability Payment Rates</h2>

      <p>VA disability compensation rates for 2025 received a 2.5% Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) effective December 1, 2024 (with retroactive payments for December 2024 paid on January 1, 2025), reflecting inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index. These rates represent significant increases from previous years, with 100% disability compensation rising from $3,737.85 monthly to over $3,800 when considering dependent allowances. The payment structure recognizes both disability severity and family circumstances, with additional compensation for veterans rated 30% or higher who have qualifying dependents.</p>

      <h3>Additional Dependent Allowances (2025 Rates)</h3>
      <p>Veterans rated 30% or higher receive additional monthly compensation for qualifying dependents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Each child under 18:</strong> Ranges from $31 (at 30%) to $75 (at 100%) per child monthly</li>
        <li><strong>Each child over 18 in school:</strong> Ranges from $101 (at 30%) to $242 (at 100%) per child monthly</li>
        <li><strong>Spouse requiring aid and attendance:</strong> Ranges from $62 (at 30%) to $171 (at 100%) monthly additional</li>
        <li><strong>Each dependent parent:</strong> Ranges from $86 (at 30%, one parent) to $278 (at 100%, two parents) monthly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dependent Benefits Eligibility and Requirements</h2>

      <p>VA dependent benefits provide additional monthly compensation for veterans rated 30% or higher who support qualifying family members, recognizing the financial responsibilities that disabilities place on families. To receive dependent benefits, you must formally add dependents to your VA records by submitting VA Form 21-686c (Declaration of Status of Dependents) along with required supporting documentation such as marriage certificates, birth certificates, school enrollment verification, and medical evidence for aid and attendance claims.</p>

      <h3>Qualifying Dependents Categories</h3>

      <p><strong>Spouse:</strong> You must be legally married as recognized by the state where the marriage occurred. Common-law marriages are recognized if valid in the state where established. Same-sex marriages are fully recognized following the Supreme Court's Obergefell decision. Separated spouses still qualify unless divorce is finalized. Spouse benefits terminate upon divorce or remarriage (though you can reclaim benefits if subsequent marriage ends).</p>

      <p><strong>Children Under 18:</strong> Includes biological children, adopted children (adoption finalized), and stepchildren if you're married to the parent. Benefits automatically terminate when the child turns 18 unless they qualify for the school extension. Children must be unmarried to qualify for dependent benefits.</p>

      <p><strong>Children 18-23 in School:</strong> Unmarried children ages 18-23 enrolled full-time in approved educational institutions (high schools, colleges, universities, vocational schools) qualify for higher dependent allowances. Students must maintain full-time status and submit annual school enrollment certifications (VA Form 21-674). Benefits continue during normal school breaks but terminate if the student drops to part-time status or marries.</p>

      <p><strong>Children Permanently Disabled Before Age 18:</strong> Children of any age who became permanently incapable of self-support before turning 18 qualify for lifetime dependent benefits. Requires medical evidence demonstrating the disability prevents substantial gainful employment. The child must be unmarried, though marriage after age 18 doesn't automatically disqualify if the marriage ends.</p>

      <p><strong>Dependent Parents:</strong> Your parents (biological, adoptive, or in loco parentis) qualify if their annual income falls below VA-established limits (approximately $24,000 for 2025, adjusted annually). Parent dependency requires that you provide financial support and that the parent lacks sufficient income for self-support. Each parent qualifies independently based on their individual income, and rates differ for one parent versus two parents.</p>

      <p><strong>Spouse Requiring Aid and Attendance:</strong> Spouses who need assistance with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, feeding, toileting) or are bedridden or institutionalized qualify for additional monthly compensation. Requires medical evidence from a physician documenting the need for aid and attendance. This benefit is in addition to the regular spouse allowance.</p>

        <h4 style="margin: 0 0 0.75rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">🎖️ Maximizing Dependent Benefits</h4>
        <p><strong>Timing Matters:</strong> Add dependents to your VA records as soon as you become eligible (marriage, birth, adoption) to avoid missing entitled benefits. The VA typically backdates dependent benefits only to the date you notify them, not to the actual event date.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>School Certification:</strong> For children 18-23, submit school enrollment verification promptly each academic year. Late submissions can cause payment delays or require repayment of suspended benefits.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>Parent Income:</strong> Review parent dependency annually. If a parent's income falls below VA limits due to retirement or reduced Social Security, they may newly qualify as dependents.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Filing Your VA Disability Claim</h2>

      <p>Filing a VA disability claim initiates the formal process of seeking compensation for service-connected conditions, requiring careful preparation, thorough documentation, and strategic timing to maximize your chances of approval and appropriate rating assignment. The claim filing process can take 3-18 months depending on claim complexity, required examinations, and regional office workload, though the VA's stated goal is completing claims within 125 days. Your efforts in preparing a comprehensive, well-documented claim significantly impact both approval likelihood and initial rating assignment, potentially affecting your lifetime compensation by tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

      <h3>Types of VA Disability Claims</h3>

      <p><strong>Original Claim (First-Time):</strong> Your first claim for VA disability compensation, typically filed within one year of separation for optimal effective date assignment. First-time claimants should consider filing for all known service-connected conditions simultaneously rather than piecemeal, as this establishes service connection while evidence is fresh and witnesses are available.</p>

      <p><strong>Reopened Claim:</strong> A new claim for a previously denied condition when you have new and material evidence that wasn't available during the original decision. New evidence must be relevant to the claim and have the potential to change the outcome. The effective date for reopened claims is the date of the new claim, not the original claim date.</p>

      <p><strong>Supplemental Claim:</strong> Filed after a claim denial when you have new and relevant evidence. Supplemental claims are part of the VA's modernized appeals system (Appeals Modernization Act of 2017) and allow you to submit new evidence and receive a new decision without appealing. If approved, the effective date typically reverts to the original claim date.</p>

      <p><strong>Secondary Claim:</strong> Claims for conditions caused or aggravated by an already service-connected condition. For example, if you're service-connected for a knee injury and subsequently develop back problems due to altered gait, the back condition is secondary to the knee condition. Secondary conditions can significantly increase combined ratings.</p>

      <p><strong>Increase Claim:</strong> Requests a higher rating for an already service-connected condition that has worsened since the last rating decision. Requires current medical evidence demonstrating increased severity. Note that increase claims can result in unchanged, increased, or (rarely) decreased ratings if evidence shows improvement.</p>

      <h3>Essential Steps for Filing a Strong Claim</h3>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Gather Service Treatment Records (STRs):</strong> Obtain complete military medical records documenting in-service treatment, injuries, illnesses, or symptoms. Request records from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) or through your personnel file. STRs establish the "in-service" element of service connection.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Obtain Current Medical Evidence:</strong> Schedule examinations with private physicians, VA providers, or specialists to document current condition severity and symptoms. Recent medical records (within past 12 months) carry more weight than older documentation. Detailed physician statements describing functional limitations are particularly valuable.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Establish Service Connection:</strong> Prepare evidence showing: (1) current diagnosed condition, (2) in-service event, injury, or illness, and (3) medical nexus (link) between current condition and service. Nexus letters from physicians stating it is "at least as likely as not" (50% or higher probability) that the condition is related to service are critical.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Document Symptom Severity:</strong> Maintain symptom logs documenting frequency, intensity, and impact of symptoms on daily activities and work capacity. Specific examples of functional limitations (can't stand longer than 30 minutes, wake 3-4 times nightly due to pain) strengthen claims more than vague descriptions.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Submit VA Form 21-526EZ:</strong> Complete the Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits through VA.gov, eBenefits, mail, or at a VA Regional Office. Ensure you list all conditions being claimed, even if you're unsure about service connection—the VA has a duty to assist in developing claims.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Consider Fully Developed Claims (FDC):</strong> If you submit all evidence upfront without needing VA assistance gathering records, your claim enters the FDC program for potentially faster processing. However, don't rush to file FDC if you're missing critical evidence—thoroughness trumps speed.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Attend C&P Examinations:</strong> The VA will likely schedule Compensation & Pension examinations to evaluate your claimed conditions. Attend all scheduled exams (missing exams can result in claim denial), be honest about symptoms and limitations, and bring copies of medical records to the examination.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Work with Accredited Representatives:</strong> Consider assistance from Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), accredited claims agents, or VA-accredited attorneys. VSO representation is free and can significantly improve claim outcomes through their expertise and experience navigating VA processes.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The VA Appeals Process</h2>

      <p>The VA appeals process allows veterans to challenge unfavorable decisions regarding disability claims, including denials, inadequate rating percentages, or effective date disagreements. The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) of 2019 reformed the appeals system, replacing the legacy three-lane system with three distinct review options designed to provide faster decisions and more choice in how appeals are reviewed. Understanding your appeal options and strategic selection can save years of waiting and potentially secure higher compensation backdated to your original claim filing date.</p>

      <h3>Three Appeal Options Under the AMA</h3>

      <p><strong>Supplemental Claim:</strong> File a new claim with additional evidence not previously submitted. This option allows you to add new medical records, nexus opinions, buddy statements, or other relevant evidence supporting your claim. If the supplemental claim results in a favorable decision, your effective date typically returns to your original claim date, recovering all backdated benefits. Processing time averages 4-5 months. Best used when you have new evidence that addresses the specific reasons for denial.</p>

      <p><strong>Higher-Level Review:</strong> Request that a senior VA reviewer re-examine the same evidence from your claim without adding new evidence. The senior reviewer looks for errors in how the law or regulations were applied to your case. You can request an informal conference call to identify errors. Higher-level reviews typically take 4-5 months. Best used when you believe the rating decision made clear errors in applying the law or regulations to the evidence already in the file.</p>

      <p><strong>Board Appeal:</strong> Appeal directly to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, where a Veterans Law Judge will review your case. You can choose from three Board appeal lanes: (1) Direct Review (no new evidence, no hearing, faster decision in about 1 year), (2) Evidence Submission (can submit new evidence, no hearing, 2-3 years), or (3) Hearing Request (present testimony and evidence, 3-5 years for decision). Board decisions are binding but can be further appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.</p>

      <h3>Strategic Appeal Selection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Have strong new evidence?</strong> File a Supplemental Claim—it's typically faster and preserves your original claim date</li>
        <li><strong>Denial based on procedural error?</strong> Choose Higher-Level Review to correct mistakes without starting over</li>
        <li><strong>Complex legal issues?</strong> Board appeal with hearing allows you to explain intricate service connection arguments</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple denied conditions?</strong> You can file different appeal types for different issues simultaneously</li>
        <li><strong>Time-sensitive?</strong> Supplemental Claim and Higher-Level Review are fastest (4-5 months average)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Special Monthly Compensation (SMC)</h2>

      <p>Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) provides additional tax-free benefits beyond standard disability compensation for veterans with especially severe disabilities or combinations of disabilities at maximum rating levels. SMC recognizes extraordinarily disabling conditions such as loss of use of limbs, blindness, need for aid and attendance with daily activities, or being housebound. SMC can add hundreds to over $4,000 monthly to your base compensation depending on severity, making it one of the most valuable but underutilized VA benefits.</p>

      <h3>Common SMC Situations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SMC-K (Loss of Use):</strong> Loss or loss of use of a hand, foot, eye, or reproductive organ. Adds approximately $123 monthly. Can be combined for multiple losses.</li>
        <li><strong>SMC-L (Basic Aid and Attendance):</strong> Need for aid and attendance with activities of daily living OR housebound status. Adds approximately $5,300 monthly above 100% rating. Requires medical evidence of need for assistance or inability to leave home.</li>
        <li><strong>SMC-S (Housebound):</strong> Substantially confined to home due to disability. Adds approximately $428 monthly above 100% rating. Less than aid and attendance but more than base 100%.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher SMC Levels (M through R):</strong> Anatomical loss or loss of use of multiple limbs, or need for regular aid and attendance. These levels can exceed $10,000 monthly for the most severely disabled veterans.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <h4 style="margin: 0 0 0.75rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">⚠️ Important: Claims Don't Expire</h4>
        <p>Many veterans believe they must file claims immediately after discharge or lose entitlement. This is false—you can file VA disability claims at any time after discharge, even decades later. While filing within one year of separation typically provides the most favorable effective date (potentially your separation date), you're never "too late" to file.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>Effective Date Rules:</strong> For claims filed within one year of discharge, the effective date can be your separation date. For claims filed after one year, the effective date is typically the date your claim was received by the VA. Regardless, if you have service-connected disabilities causing current symptoms, file now—even a 10% rating pays over $2,000 annually tax-free for life.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Individual Unemployability (TDIU)</h2>

      <p>Total Disability Based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU) allows veterans to receive 100% disability compensation even if their combined rating is less than 100%, when service-connected disabilities prevent securing or maintaining substantially gainful employment. TDIU recognizes that disability impact extends beyond medical impairment measured by percentage ratings—some veterans with 70% ratings face more severe employment barriers than others with higher ratings. TDIU can increase monthly compensation from $1,716 (70%) to $3,737 (100%), an additional $2,021 monthly or over $24,000 annually.</p>

      <h3>TDIU Eligibility Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rating Thresholds:</strong> One condition rated at least 60% OR combined rating of at least 70% with one condition at least 40%. Extraschedular TDIU is possible if you don't meet thresholds but still cannot work due to service-connected disabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Unemployability:</strong> Cannot secure or maintain substantially gainful employment due to service-connected disabilities. "Substantially gainful" generally means exceeding poverty-level wages (approximately $13,000-14,000 annually as of 2025).</li>
        <li><strong>Service Connection:</strong> Your unemployability must result from service-connected conditions, not non-service-connected disabilities or voluntary career choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Marginal Employment Exception:</strong> Working part-time in a protected environment (family business, supported employment) earning below marginal employment threshold doesn't automatically disqualify TDIU.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Additional VA Benefits by Disability Rating</h2>

      <p>VA disability ratings unlock various additional benefits beyond monthly compensation, with benefit eligibility often tied to specific rating thresholds. Understanding these additional benefits helps veterans appreciate the true value of higher ratings and motivates thorough claim filing and appeals when appropriate.</p>

      <h3>Benefits by Rating Tier</h3>

      <p><strong>30% Rating and Above:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dependent allowances for spouse, children, and parents</li>
        <li>Priority Group 1 for VA healthcare (highest priority, free care for service-connected conditions)</li>
        <li>Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E Chapter 31) vocational rehabilitation eligibility</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>50% Rating and Above:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Commissary and Exchange shopping privileges (online only, expanded to in-person in some locations)</li>
        <li>Property tax exemptions in most states (varies by state, typically partial exemption)</li>
        <li>Automobile Allowance and Adaptive Equipment grant eligibility for certain disabilities</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>100% Rating (Permanent and Total):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>CHAMPVA coverage for spouse and dependents (if not eligible for TRICARE)</li>
        <li>Dental care through VA (usually limited to service-connected dental conditions, but 100% P&T expands eligibility)</li>
        <li>Full property tax exemption in many states</li>
        <li>State benefits such as free or reduced vehicle registration, hunting/fishing licenses, state park passes</li>
        <li>Chapter 35 Dependent Educational Assistance (DEA) for spouse and children</li>
        <li>Survivors' benefits protection—dependents automatically eligible for DIC if veteran passes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common VA Disability Claim Mistakes</h2>

      <div class="veteran-box">
        <h4 style="margin: 0 0 0.75rem; font-size: 1.2rem;">🚫 Critical Errors to Avoid</h4>
        <ol style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
          <li><strong>Understating symptoms during C&P exams:</strong> Veterans often downplay symptoms trying to appear tough or not "complain." Be completely honest about your worst days, symptom frequency, and functional limitations. The examiner needs accurate information to assign appropriate ratings.</li>
          <li><strong>Filing incomplete claims:</strong> Missing medical records, lack of nexus opinions, or vague symptom descriptions lead to denials or low ratings. Gather comprehensive evidence before filing, or work with VSOs to identify evidence gaps.</li>
          <li><strong>Not claiming all conditions:</strong> File for every service-connected condition, even if you're unsure about service connection. Conditions denied now become harder to claim later. It's better to claim and be denied than never claim at all.</li>
          <li><strong>Missing C&P examination appointments:</strong> Failure to attend scheduled examinations typically results in automatic claim denial. Reschedule if needed, but never simply skip appointments.</li>
          <li><strong>Not requesting increases when conditions worsen:</strong> If your condition deteriorates, file an increase claim promptly. Waiting years means losing retroactive benefits—effective dates for increases are the date you filed the increase request.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring secondary conditions:</strong> Service-connected conditions often cause or aggravate other conditions. Knee injuries lead to back problems, PTSD causes sleep apnea, medications cause side effects. Always file secondary claims.</li>
          <li><strong>Accepting initial decisions without review:</strong> Initial claim decisions are wrong more often than you'd expect. Have VSOs or attorneys review your decision letter before accepting the outcome.</li>
          <li><strong>Not maintaining medical treatment:</strong> Gaps in treatment harm claims, suggesting conditions aren't severe. Maintain consistent treatment and document symptoms with healthcare providers.</li>
          <li><strong>Failing to report life changes:</strong> Inform VA of marriages, births, adoptions, divorces, child turning 18, children entering college—all affect dependent compensation. Report within 30 days to avoid payment adjustments or overpayments requiring repayment.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h2>Conclusion: Securing the Benefits You've Earned</h2>

      <p>VA disability compensation represents the nation's commitment to caring for veterans whose service resulted in disabilities affecting their health, livelihoods, and quality of life. Key takeaways from this guide:</p>
