  ‚úì Desktop Chrome (47 passed)
  ‚úì Desktop Firefox (47 passed)
  ‚úì Desktop Safari (47 passed)
  ‚úì Mobile Chrome (47 passed)
  ‚úì Mobile Safari (47 passed)

235 passed (2m 30s)

Serving HTML report at http://localhost:9323
```

**This means:**
- All tests passed ‚úÖ
- Calculator working correctly across all browsers
- Ready for production

#### ‚ùå Failed Test Run

```
Running 235 tests using 5 workers

  ‚úì Desktop Chrome (47 passed)
  ‚úì Desktop Firefox (46 passed, 1 failed)
  ‚úì Desktop Safari (47 passed)
  ‚úì Mobile Chrome (47 passed)
  ‚úì Mobile Safari (47 passed)

234 passed, 1 failed (2m 35s)

  1) Desktop Firefox ‚Ä∫ should calculate 18% GST correctly
```

**This means:**
- 234 tests passed, 1 failed
- Issue in Firefox browser
- Check HTML report for details

### Understanding Test Failures

When a test fails, you'll see:

```
1) [Desktop Firefox] ‚Ä∫ should calculate 18% GST correctly

    Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)

    Expected: 11800
    Received: 11799

      at gst-calculator.spec.js:123:45
```

**What this tells you:**
- **Browser**: Desktop Firefox
- **Test**: "should calculate 18% GST correctly"
- **Issue**: Expected ‚Çπ11,800 but got ‚Çπ11,799
- **Location**: Line 123 in test file

### Checking Failure Artifacts

After a failed test, check:

#### 1. Screenshots
```bash
ls test-results/screenshots/
```

View the screenshot showing the state when test failed.

#### 2. Videos
```bash
ls test-results/videos/
```

Watch full video recording of the failed test.

#### 3. Trace Files
```bash
ls test-results/traces/
```

Open in Playwright Trace Viewer for time-travel debugging.

### HTML Report Details

## üîß Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Port 8000 Already in Use

**Error Message:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::8000
```

**Solution:**

Kill the process using port 8000:
```bash
# Find and kill process
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Or use npm script
npm run server:stop
```

Then run tests again:
```bash
npm test
```

---

### Issue 2: Browsers Not Installed

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Playwright browsers are not installed.
```

**Solution:**

Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
npm run install
```

Or manually:
```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

---

### Issue 3: Tests Timing Out

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Timeout 30000ms exceeded
```

**Solution:**

Increase timeout in `playwright.config.js`:
```javascript
timeout: 60 * 1000,  // 60 seconds instead of 30
```

Or run with fewer parallel workers:
```bash
npx playwright test --workers=1
```

---

### Issue 4: WebKit (Safari) Not Working on Linux

**Error Message:**
```
Error: WebKit is not installed
```

**Solution:**

Install WebKit dependencies:
```bash
sudo npx playwright install-deps webkit
```

**Note:** WebKit has limited support on some Linux distributions.

---

### Issue 5: Tests Are Flaky (Random Failures)

**Symptoms:**
- Tests pass sometimes, fail other times
- Different results on different runs

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase wait times** for dynamic content
2. **Run serially** instead of parallel:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --workers=1
   ```
3. **Enable retries** in `playwright.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   retries: 2,  // Retry failed tests twice
   ```

---

### Issue 6: Python Not Found

**Error Message:**
```
Error: python3: command not found
```

**Solution:**

Install Python 3:
- **macOS**: `brew install python3`
- **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install python3`
- **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)

Or start server manually:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
npm test
```

---

### Issue 7: Permission Denied Errors

**Error Message:**
```
Error: EACCES: permission denied
```

**Solution:**

Fix permissions:
```bash
chmod -R 755 .
```

Or run with sudo (not recommended):
```bash
sudo npm test
```

---

### Issue 8: Node.js Version Too Old

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Node.js version must be >= 16.0.0
```

**Solution:**

Update Node.js:
```bash
# Check current version
node --version

# Update using nvm (recommended)
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# Or download latest from nodejs.org
```

---

### Issue 9: Tests Pass Locally But Fail in CI

**Possible Causes:**
- Different environment variables
- Missing dependencies
- Timing issues due to slower CI servers

**Solutions:**

1. **Use CI-specific configuration:**
   ```bash
   CI=true npm test
   ```

2. **Check CI logs** for specific errors

3. **Add retries** for CI environment:
   ```javascript
   retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
   ```

---

### Issue 10: Cannot Read Test Results

**Issue:** HTML report doesn't open

**Solution:**

View report manually:
```bash
# Open in default browser
open playwright-report/index.html  # macOS
xdg-open playwright-report/index.html  # Linux
start playwright-report/index.html  # Windows
```

Or check JSON results:
```bash
cat test-results/results.json
```

### What This Does

1. **Triggers on:**
   - Every push to `main` or `develop`
   - Every pull request
   - Daily at 2 AM UTC (catches issues early)

2. **Runs:**
   - Tests in parallel across 3 browsers
   - On Ubuntu (similar to production)
   - With CI optimizations enabled

3. **Reports:**
   - Uploads test reports as artifacts
   - Available for 30 days
   - Includes screenshots and videos

### Setting Up on Other CI Platforms

#### GitLab CI

Add to `.gitlab-ci.yml`:
```yaml
test:
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run install
    - npm test
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - playwright-report/
    expire_in: 30 days
```

#### CircleCI

Add to `.circleci/config.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2.1
jobs:
  test:
    docker:
      - image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run install
      - run: npm test
      - store_artifacts:
          path: playwright-report
```

#### Jenkins

Add to `Jenkinsfile`:
```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm ci'
        sh 'npm run install'
        sh 'npm test'
      }
    }
  }
  post {
    always {
      publishHTML([
        reportDir: 'playwright-report',
        reportFiles: 'index.html',
        reportName: 'Playwright Report'
