## 🔧 Configuration

### Key Settings (playwright.config.ts)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per test
- **Retries**: 2 on CI, 0 locally
- **Parallel**: Tests run in parallel
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Screenshots**: Captured on failure
- **Videos**: Recorded on failure
- **Traces**: Captured on retry

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Run in CI mode (with retries)
CI=true npx playwright test

# Test against different base URL
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx playwright test
```

## 📈 GST Calculation Formulas

### GST Exclusive (Add GST)
```
GST Amount = Original Amount × GST Rate
Total Amount = Original Amount + GST Amount

Example: ₹10,000 + 18% GST
GST = 10,000 × 0.18 = ₹1,800
Total = 10,000 + 1,800 = ₹11,800
```

### GST Inclusive (Remove GST)
```
Original Amount = Total Amount / (1 + GST Rate)
GST Amount = Total Amount - Original Amount

Example: ₹11,800 with 18% GST
Original = 11,800 / 1.18 = ₹10,000
GST = 11,800 - 10,000 = ₹1,800
```

### CGST/SGST (Intrastate)
```
CGST = (Original Amount × GST Rate) / 2
SGST = (Original Amount × GST Rate) / 2

Example: ₹10,000 + 18% GST
CGST = (10,000 × 0.18) / 2 = ₹900
SGST = (10,000 × 0.18) / 2 = ₹900
```

### IGST (Interstate)
```
IGST = Original Amount × GST Rate
CGST = 0
SGST = 0

Example: ₹10,000 + 18% GST
IGST = 10,000 × 0.18 = ₹1,800
```

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Tests

### 1. Check screenshots
```bash
# Screenshots are saved in test-results/
ls test-results/
```

### 2. Watch test execution
```bash
npx playwright test --headed --workers=1
```

### 3. Use Playwright Inspector
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

### 4. Check browser console logs
Tests automatically capture console logs on failure.

## 📝 Adding New Tests

### Template for new test:
```typescript
test('should [describe what it tests]', async ({ page }) => {
  // 1. Setup
  await page.goto(BASE_URL);
  await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  
  // 2. Action
  await page.fill('#amount', '10000');
  await page.selectOption('#gstRateDropdown', '18');
  await page.waitForTimeout(500);
  
  // 3. Assert
  const totalAmount = await page.locator('#totalAmount').textContent();
  expect(parseIndianCurrency(totalAmount!)).toBe(11800);
});
```

## 🎨 Best Practices

1. **Wait for calculations**: Use `await page.waitForTimeout(500)` after input changes
2. **Use Indian formatting**: Expect results in Indian number format (₹1,00,000)
3. **Test both modes**: Always test GST Exclusive and Inclusive
4. **Test transaction types**: Test both Intrastate (CGST/SGST) and Interstate (IGST)
5. **Use real-world amounts**: Test with common amounts (restaurant bills, phone prices, etc.)
6. **Test edge cases**: Don't forget decimals, zero, large numbers, negative numbers
7. **Mobile testing**: Always test on mobile viewports
8. **Performance**: Tests should complete in <30 seconds each
