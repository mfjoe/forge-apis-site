    - heading "Understanding Monitor Response Time & Input Lag" [level=2] [ref=e63]
    - paragraph [ref=e64]: Monitor response time is one of the most misunderstood specifications in gaming displays. While manufacturers love to advertise "1ms response time" as a selling point, the reality is far more complex. True input lag—the delay between your action and what you see on screen—involves multiple components working together, and that "1ms" number only tells part of the story.
    - paragraph [ref=e65]:
      - strong [ref=e66]: What is response time?
      - text: Response time measures how quickly a pixel can change from one color to another, typically measured in milliseconds (ms). The most common metric is GtG (Gray-to-Gray), which tracks how fast pixels transition between shades of gray. However, this doesn't account for the full picture. MPRT (Moving Picture Response Time) measures perceived motion blur, which is often higher than GtG claims. Most importantly, neither of these directly measures input lag—the delay from when your GPU sends a frame to when it appears on your monitor.
    - paragraph [ref=e67]:
      - strong [ref=e68]: "The total system latency equation:"
      - text: "Real-world input lag is calculated by combining multiple delays: monitor processing time (typically 5-15ms), panel response time (GtG, usually 1-5ms), refresh rate delay (16.67ms at 60Hz, 8.33ms at 120Hz, 4.17ms at 240Hz, 2.78ms at 360Hz), GPU frame time (varies), and peripheral input delay (1-5ms for mice/keyboards). This means a monitor with \"1ms GtG\" might still have 15-25ms of total input lag, while a monitor with \"5ms GtG\" could have lower total input lag if it has better processing and higher refresh rates."
    - paragraph [ref=e69]:
      - strong [ref=e70]: "Why refresh rate matters more than advertised response time:"
      - text: A 360Hz monitor with 5ms GtG will feel dramatically more responsive than a 60Hz monitor with 1ms GtG. This is because refresh rate directly impacts input lag—higher refresh rates mean less time between frames, resulting in lower perceived latency. For competitive gaming, many professionals prioritize high refresh rates (240Hz, 360Hz) over ultra-low response time claims, especially since most modern gaming monitors have sufficiently fast response times when properly configured with overdrive settings.

          - text: measures how quickly a pixel can change from one color to another, typically measured in milliseconds (ms). For gaming, response time directly affects motion clarity and ghosting. A faster response time (1ms) means pixels transition quickly, reducing blur trails behind moving objects. A slower response time (5ms+) can cause visible ghosting, where previous frames leave faint afterimages.

        - paragraph [ref=e304]: A monitor advertising "1ms GtG" means its pixels can transition between certain gray shades in 1 millisecond. However, transitions between very different colors (like black to white) may take 3-5ms or more. Real-world response times are often higher than advertised GtG times because games display various colors, not just gray transitions.
        - paragraph [ref=e305]: MPRT (Moving Picture Response Time) is often more accurate for gaming because it measures response time during actual motion, accounting for all color transitions. If a monitor claims 1ms GtG, expect actual gaming response times of 2-4ms.

          - text: (G-Sync, FreeSync, VRR) is technology that dynamically adjusts your monitor's refresh rate to match your GPU's frame rate in real-time. This eliminates screen tearing and stuttering without adding significant input lag.
        - paragraph [ref=e689]: Traditional monitors have a fixed refresh rate (e.g., 144Hz). If your GPU outputs 90 FPS, the monitor still refreshes at 144Hz, showing some frames twice and creating stutter. With adaptive sync, the monitor automatically adjusts to 90Hz, displaying each frame exactly once for smooth motion.

        - paragraph [ref=e700]: VRR solves the fundamental problem of mismatched frame rates and refresh rates.

      - paragraph [ref=e2081]:
        - strong [ref=e2082]: Why 24" not 27"?
        - text: Tournament standard, entire screen in peripheral vision, less eye movement needed. Pros sit 18-20 inches from screen - closer than casual gamers.
      - paragraph [ref=e2083]:
        - strong [ref=e2084]: Why 1080p not 1440p?
        - text: Easier to maintain 300+ FPS for consistent input lag. In competitive FPS, frame rate > visual quality. Most competitive games are optimized for 1080p visibility.
      - paragraph [ref=e2085]:
        - strong [ref=e2086]: "Why Some Pros Still Use TN:"
        - text: 0.5ms response vs 1-2ms Fast IPS. At professional level, 0.5-1.5ms difference is perceivable. However, newer pros increasingly choose Fast IPS for better colors with minimal speed penalty.
      - generic [ref=e2087]:
        - strong [ref=e2088]: "Reality Check:"
        - text: If you're not playing at professional/semi-pro level, you don't need pro-level equipment. The difference between 8ms and 10ms input lag won't affect your rank. Focus on specs matching YOUR skill level and budget.
